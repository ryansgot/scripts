# scripts
Some of my useful bash/python scripts

In order to use these effectively, you'll need the following defined in your bash_profile or bashrc file:
```
# For scripts
export NOTE_DIR="$HOME/notes"               # this is just an example
export SCRIPT_DIR="$HOME/script"            # this is just an example
export TEMPLATE_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/templates" # this is stored in the repo, so you should copy this line
export FUNCTION_LIB_DIR="$SCRIPT_DIR/lib"   # this is stored in the repo, so you should copy this line
export MY_BIN_DIR="$HOME/bin"               # this is just an example

# update path
export PATH="$PATH:$MY_BIN_DIR"

```
